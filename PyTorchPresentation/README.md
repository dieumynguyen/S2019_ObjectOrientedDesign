<b>Graduate Presentation Project:</b> PyTorch: A deep learning package for Python

<b>Due:</b> 15 April 2019

<b>Team member(s):</b> Dieu My Nguyen

<b>Program description:</b> In the PyTorchCodeExamples.ipynb notebook are code examples for full PyTorch presentation.

The first section of the notebook cover the concept of tensor and basic operations on them in PyTorch, such constructing, indexing, reshaping, and concatenating.

The second section is an example of a convolutional neural network (CNN) built and trained in PyTorch using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. This section details PyTorch functionalities as well as some core neural network concepts not covered in the presentation. There is also example output showing the loss and test accuracy values over 20 epochs (short due to limited CPU!).

<b>Instructions to run code:</b> Simply run the Python code cells in the Jupyter Notebook. Cells are pre-run to show sample output.
